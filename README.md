This is "NanoWiki", NanoWiki is a program, it's written in go;
what it does is that it connects to localhost:8080 and all pages are 
locally hosted as `*.txt` files. Soooo, any `*.txt` file can be loaded
by NanoWiki! 

## How to use 
To use simply:
```bash
cd <NanoWiki directory>
make
./nanowiki
```
This will run the "NanoWiki" file. Then, open your browser of choice,
go to the url: 
```bash
localhost:8080/view/<Page>
```
If the page
doesn't exist, you will be brought to an "/edit/" page, to write it yourself. All
of the pages will be saved to your computer as "*.txt" files.

## Why use NanoWiki?
NanoWiki can be used as a cool showcase to friends, some note-taking software,
or a base for a project bigger than NanoWiki could've ever been!

## Conclusions
Feel free to contribute to NanoWiki, as it could definitely do with some work ðŸ˜ƒ!
And with that, enjoy!
